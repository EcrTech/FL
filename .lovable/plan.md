# Remove Dropped Azure Deployment Workflow

## What Changes

Delete only the old, dropped Azure Static Web Apps workflow file:

- **Delete:** `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-polite-field-0bd47cb1e.yml`

The other workflow file (`azure-static-web-apps-victorious-mushroom-0b9caf41e.yml`) will be kept as-is since it powers the active deployment.
